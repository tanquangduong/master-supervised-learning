Master Supervised Learning

## ✅ Setup Env
- Create Python environment\
`conda create -n env_name python=3.10`\
`conda activate env_name`
- Create Python environment\
`pip install -r .\path_to_requirements\requirements.txt`


## ✅ Supervised learning
- Classifier: If the target variable is a category variable, the machine learning model is called a classifier. Classifiers can be used to answer the following type of business questions:
  - Is this abnormal tissue growth a malignant tumor? 
  - Based on the current weather conditions, will it rain tomorrow? 
  - Based on the profile of a particular applicant, should their mortgage application be approved?
- Regressors: If the target variable is a continuous variable, we train a regressor. Regressors can be used to answer the following types of business questions:
  - Based on the current weather condition, how much will it rain tomorrow? 
  - What will the price of a particular home be with given characteristics?

- Decision tree:  Use-case:
  - Mortgage applications: To train a binary classifier to determine whether an applicant is likely to default.  
  - Customer segmentation: To categorize customers into high-worth, medium-worth, and low-worth customers so that marketing strategies can be customized for each category. 
  - Medical diagnosis: To train a classifier that can categorize a benign or malignant growth. 
  - Treatment-effectiveness analysis: To train a classifier that can flag patients that have reacted positively to a particular treatment.
